                    What do a freelance photographer, a lawyer, and the CEO of a company have in common? All of them
                    require websites. That's both simpler and trickier than ever in the modern world. Professional
                    websites are now accessible to both non-designers and non-techies thanks to web designers, software
                    developers and the development of site builders. But just because something is simple doesn't mean
                    it's the best course of action. I have a ton of experience in this area and am aware of both the
                    good and the bad. To find out how to achieve it, keep reading.

                <h4>Why it's Worth It to Build a Website</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Even if your company is fresh new, investing in a website is always worthwhile. A good website gives
                    your business a lasting online presence, access to audiences throughout the world, credibility, and
                    easy scaling. Since social media is free and simple to use, some businesses rely on it for this.
                    However, using
                    social media by itself is insufficient to expand your audience and engage with your clients. You are
                    at the mercy of constantly altering algorithms when using social media. If you only use
                    Facebook and Instagram, you risk losing clients who are already using your products or services.

                <h4>The Investment Needed to Create a Website</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Technically, you can create a website for free. But it's not advised to do this.

                    Free websites frequently employ branded subdomains, which aren't practical for commercial use.
                    Additionally, they include additional spammy adverts, which severely restricts how much you may
                    expand. There are no free website platforms that come to mind that provide sufficient storage,
                    bandwidth, and other resources to support a profitable website.

                    Even if your website won't be entirely free, you won't need to pay a fortune to launch a
                    high-quality website.

                    You may receive quick and dependable web hosting as well as a free name for just a few dollars per
                    month.

                    <br><br>

                    My preferred web host for fresh websites is Hostinger. Starting at $1.99 per month, entry-level
                    plans provide you four years of web hosting for less than $100.

                    Additionally, you must get a domain name, which will cost you $10 to $15 a year. It will cost an
                    additional $10 a year to protect your WHOIS information for that domain.

                    As an alternative, if you upgrade to Hostinger's WordPress Starter service, you will receive a free
                    domain name. You get a free domain, improved performance, and a server tailored specifically for
                    WordPress for $3.99 per month.

                    You may secure dependable web hosting and a domain name that is locked down for four years for an
                    initial expenditure of between $150 and $250.

                    <br><br>

                    The greatest method to obtain the best value is with longer contracts. But if you choose a one-year
                    plan, you can still launch a website for less than $100.

                    In terms of time, you can have your site operational in a few hours. However, plan to dedicate at
                    least a few days to building the website, writing the material, and making minor adjustments to your
                    taste.

                <p>
                    Without further ado, let's look at how to quickly create a website from scratch.

                <h4>Step 1 — Select a Hosting Plan</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    You should pick a hosting company with a solid reputation when it comes to hosting your small
                    business website. Additionally, you want to confirm that the business has excellent customer service
                    to assist you with any issues or questions you may have.

                    Reading reviews and learning about the benefits and drawbacks of each web hosting provider is the
                    best method to determine which one is ideal for you.

                    If you're on a tight budget, going with Bluehost can be a good idea as they offer shared hosting
                    plans that start at $13 per month.
                    <br><br>
                    Another excellent choice is SiteGround, which has shared hosting
                    packages starting at about $5 per month. Additionally, when you set up a hosting account with them,
                    their plan offers a free domain name registration.

                    WP Engine can be the best hosting company for you if you're seeking for a more powerful hosting
                    package. They offer managed WordPress hosting plans as part of their hosting offerings, allowing
                    WordPress users to quickly and easily create a beautiful, mobile-friendly website. If you want a
                    quick, dependable, and secure website, this kind of hosting is ideal.

                <h4>Step 2 — Figure Out Your Domain Name</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Your website's address is its domain name. Ours is www.crazyegg.com, as an illustration.

                    Your customers will enter it to view your content in their web browsers. It should be pertinent,
                    memorable, and as closely related to what you intend to do with your firm as feasible.

                    Here, you might run into some difficulties.

                    Your desired domain must first and foremost be available.
                    <br><br>
                    It's likely that another company will
                    already be using the domain name if you utilize popular terms and keywords.

                    It is therefore best to use original domain names.

                    After you find your domain, make sure to opt for WHOIS privacy for about an extra $10 per year. It
                    means
                    you pay a little more, yes, but it will keep your private information (like your name and address)
                    from being publicly searchable. That’s well worth it.

                    It's time to select a website builder once you've established that it suits your needs. We advise
                    using the free website builder provided by WordPress if you are on a tight budget. While WordPress
                    websites are initially free, you should reasonably expect to pay between $11 and $40 each month for
                    WordPress software after paying a one-time fee of about $200. Additionally, there are a ton of
                    online tutorials that can guide you through the process of setting up a WordPress site.
                    <br><br>
                    Another well-known website builder with a large selection of layouts and functionality is Wix. In
                    order to test the platform before committing to a premium plan, they also provide a free trial. The
                    pricing of Wix's unlimited plan for independent contractors and business owners ranges from $18 per
                    month to more based on your needs (e.g., more storage space, visitor analytics).

                <h4>Step 4 — Make a plan for future growth</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    When creating your website, it's crucial to account for future business growth if you anticipate
                    doing so. As your company expands, make sure your website is simple to maintain and add new pages
                    to. Choose a platform that can manage rising traffic and bandwidth requirements as well.

                    A WordPress site can support a small business' growth, but Wix or Squarespace are two more
                    outstanding website systems that are adaptable and strong enough to grow with you.

                    <br><br>
                    If you want a basic website, GoDaddy is of course perfect for expansion as well.

                    Shopify and BigCommerce are two of the best for allowing larger stores and e-commerce to grow.
                    Additionally, Joomla and Drupal are excellent open-source choices if you are tech inclined.

                <!------    Slot Start Start   --------->
                <h4>Step 5 — Get an SSL Certificate Straight Away</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Your website must have an SSL certificate if you wish to take payments from clients online. Secure
                    Sockets Layer, or SSL, is a security technology that websites employ to protect the connection
                    between users' web browsers and their servers. Data is encrypted so that hackers cannot access it
                    without a key to the encryption.

                    Small businesses should utilize SSL certificates since they boost client trust and help protect
                    customer data.
                    <br><br>
                    78% of consumers say they feel confident when they see the well-known padlock sign
                    connected to an SSL certificate in their browser, even if they are unaware of what an SSL is.

                    If your website lacks an SSL certificate, you run the risk of losing visitors who might not want to
                    gamble on a site without one (especially if they're making online payments). Additionally, Google
                    has the power to devalue websites that lack SSL certificates by bringing down their search engine
                    rankings.

                <h4>Step 6 — Create Pages for Your Website</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    You produce top-notch and fantastic information for your website here.

                    Pages include items like the homepage, a about page, a contact page, and a portfolio page. To draw
                    visitors and aid with SEO, you may also want to think about adding a blog page to your website.

                    WordPress has a Pages menu item on the left-hand menu bar. When a submenu appears, click Add New
                    after hovering over that.

                    You are free to write and create on the full canvas whatever you like. Then, when you're finished,
                    simply click "Publish."

                    Pages can be added at any moment, as well as edited and revised as needed.

                <h4>Step 7 — Install Plugins to Boost Your Website’s Features</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With the use of plugins, you may add features for anything from a search bar to a contact form to
                    effective SEO tools. Installing WordPress plugins to expand the functionality of your website is a
                    fantastic idea if you want it to accomplish more than just display information about your company.
                    Though there are numerous top-notch free and paid WordPress plugins available, keep in mind that
                    there shouldn't be too many of them.

                    At this point, all the necessary tasks have been completed.

                    The navigation of your website needs to be changed in order to make your content easier for people
                    to understand.

                    Testing your website frequently is the greatest approach to ensure that it is efficient. With this
                    approach, you may make changes and learn as you go. Make careful to keep track of how each component
                    performs so that you can adjust as necessary. Analyze your website traffic using analytics to
                    observe how users are interacting with it. You can use this information to select what content to
                    preserve, modify, or eliminate.

                    WordPress installation and other preparations for your site's launch are handled by the Hosting
                    serivce you chose. As
                    soon as you're done editing the design and adding content, it will be ready to use.

                    Simply check that your domain is correctly redirecting to your new website. That is conveniently
                    located in the WordPress section of your hosting dashboard. If there are any problems, the hosting
                    service
                    will let you know about them. Your domain is correctly connected if you can click on Edit Website.

                    Your website is now operational and open to visitors!

                    It's crucial to understand, though, that the effort doesn't end with the website's setup. There are
                    further things you may do to increase website traffic. Making blog articles for your website and
                    other marketing materials to publish on your new website is one of the finest ways to achieve this.
